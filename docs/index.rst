Welcome to PyNucleus' documentation!
=====================================

`PyNucleus <https://github.com/sandialabs/PyNucleus>` is a finite element code that specifically targets nonlocal operators of the form

.. math::

   \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} [u(x)-u(y)] \gamma(x, y) dy

for nonlocal kernels :math:`\gamma` with finite or infinite horizon and of integrable or fractional type.
Specific examples of such operators include the integral and regional fractional Laplacians, their truncated and tempered variants, and operators arising from peridynamics.

The package aims to provide efficient discretization and assembly routines with :math:`O(N \log N)` quasi-optimal complexity.
The resulting sets of equations can be solved using optimal linear solvers.
The code is fully NumPy/SciPy compatible, allowing easy integration into application codes.

Funding
-------

PyNucleus' development is funded through the FOMSI project (PI: Christian Glusa, FY23-FY25) of the LDRD program at Sandia National Laboratories.

PyNucleus' development was previously funded through the MATNIP project (PI: Marta D'Elia, FY20-22).

*The MATNIP project develops for the first time a rigorous nonlocal interface theory based on physical principles that is consistent with the classical theory of partial differential equations when the nonlocality vanishes and is mathematically well-posed.
This will improve the predictive capability of nonlocal models and increase their usability at Sandia and, more in general, in the computational-science and engineering community.
Furthermore, this theory will provide the groundwork for the development of nonlocal solvers, reducing the burden of prohibitively expensive computations.*
