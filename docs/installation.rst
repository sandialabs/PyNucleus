Installation
============

There are several ways to install and run PyNucleus:

* container image
* Spack installation
* manual installation

The easiest way to get up and running is probably the container image.

Pre-built container image
-------------------------

The simplest way to use PyNucleus is to pull a container image from the GitHub Container Registry.
This requires an installation of either

* `podman <https://podman.io/>`_ and `podman-compose <https://github.com/containers/podman-compose?tab=readme-ov-file#installation>`_ or
* `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ and `Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>`_.

For many Linux distributions these can be installed from the package repositories.
In what follows we will assume that we are using `podman`.
All commands for Docker should be identical up to the substitution of `podman` with `docker`.

For example, on Ubuntu podman and podman-compose can be installed with

.. code-block:: shell

   sudo apt-get install podman podman-compose

Instructions for other platforms can be found `here <https://podman.io/docs/installation>`_.

Once podman is installed, we download a copy of `compose.yaml <https://github.com/sandialabs/PyNucleus/blob/master/compose.yaml>`_ and save it to an empty directory.

.. warning::
   Please do not copy this file to your home directory and launch the container from there.
   The container keeps its state in the directory where it is launched from.

In that directory we then run

.. code-block:: shell

   podman-compose run pynucleus

podman will download a container image for PyNucleus and then launch a shell in the container.

.. note::
   The download of the image will only happen once, but it could be several GB in size.

A simple way to test if things work is to run

.. code-block:: shell

   drivers/runFractional.py

This should print some information about the solution of a fractional Laplacian problem and show several plots.

For development using PyNucleus there is the Jupyter notebook interface that is available while the container is running at https://localhost:8889 on the host system.


Spack installation
------------------

This installation compiles PyNucleus and all its dependencies from scratch.

In order to install Spack itself, follow the instructions at https://github.com/spack/spack.

Install PyNucleus and all its dependencies with the command

.. code-block:: shell

   spack install py-pynucleus

To then load PyNucleus

.. code-block:: shell

   spack load py-pynucleus

The examples can be found in the install directory. In order to get there:

.. code-block:: shell

   spack cd -i py-pynucleus


Manual installation
-------------------

In order to install PyNucleus, you will need

* Python 3,
* MPI,
* METIS,
* ParMETIS,
* SuiteSparse,
* make.

On Debian, Ubuntu etc, the required dependencies can be installed with

.. code-block:: shell

   sudo apt-get install python3 mpi-default-bin mpi-default-dev libmetis-dev libparmetis-dev libsuitesparse-dev

On MacOS the required dependencies can be installed with Homebrew (https://brew.sh/) via

.. code-block:: shell

   brew install python open-mpi
   brew tap brewsci/num
   brew install brewsci-metis brewsci-parmetis brewsci-suite-sparse

After cloning the source code from https://github.com/sandialabs/PyNucleus, PyNucleus is installed via

.. code-block:: shell

   make

The compilation of PyNucleus can be configured by modifying the file `config.yaml` in the root folder.
This allows for example to set paths for libraries that are installed in non-standard directories.
The defaults are as follows:

.. literalinclude:: ../config.yaml
   :language: yaml

If you want to easily modify the source code without re-installing the package every time, and editable install is available as

.. code-block:: shell

   make dev

PyNucleus depends on other Python packages that will be installed automatically:

* NumPy
* SciPy
* Matplotlib
* Cython
* mpi4py
* tabulate
* PyYAML
* H5py
* modepy
* meshpy
* scikit-sparse
